About
---------
Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT) provides developers with
portable and well-tested `applications <applications.html>`_ and
`libraries <modules.html>`_ covering data structures and algorithms
employed in common robotics research areas.

It is open source, released under the `BSD license <license.html>`_.


Set it up
------------

- :ref:`install`: for installing binaries for Linux or Windows.
- :ref:`compiling`: to build from sources.
