About
---------
Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT) provides developers with

`libraries <modules.html>`_ covering data structures and algorithms
employed in common robotics research areas.

It is open source, released under the `BSD license <license.html>`_.

Performance benchmarks
------------------------

Extensive performance tests are automated by means of the application `mrpt-performance`, which was moved (2018)
to `its own Git repository <https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt-performance-tests>`_.

The results on different platforms, as well as a comparison between different
compilers and platforms are published here: https://performance.mrpt.org/
